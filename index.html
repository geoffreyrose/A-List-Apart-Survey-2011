			<h1>Findings from the A LIST APART Survey 2011</h1>
			<h2>Who are you?</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Age</h3>
				<hr />
				<aside class="canvascell">
					<canvas width="600px" height="450px" class="canvasw" id="age"></canvas>
				</aside>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>18 and under</td>
						<td>1.1%</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>19-29</td>
						<td>44.3%</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>30-44</td>
						<td>47.6%</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>45-64</td>
						<td>6.7%</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>65 and over</td>
						<td>0.3%</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>Percentages are based on 14,747 responses to this question (93.9% of all respondents).</p>
				<p>The ongoing upward shift in age we noted in the 2010 results continued in 2011. For the first time since we started using these brackets in 2008, respondents in the 30-44 range (up from 44.0% in 2010) overtook those in the 19-29 range (down from 47.2% in 2010).</p>

				<h3>Gender</h3>
				<hr />
				<aside class="canvascell">
					<canvas width="600px" height="450px" class="canvasw" id="gender"></canvas>
				</aside>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>Male</td>
						<td>81.6%</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Female</td>
						<td>18.0%</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Other</td>
						<td>0.5%</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>Percentages are based on 15,623 responses to this question (99.5% of all respondents).</p>
				<p>As in years past, respondents were overwhelmingly male. Over the five years this question has been asked, a slightly higher percentage of respondents has selected female each year: 16.1% in 2007, 16.2% in 2008, 17.4% in 2009, 17.6% in 2010, and 18.0% in 2011; however, overall results are very similar to past years. The addition of Other did not appear to significantly change this pattern.</p>

			<section>
				<h3>Education</h3>
				<hr />
				<aside class="canvascell">
					<canvas width="600px" height="450px" class="canvasw" id="education"></canvas>
				</aside>
				<p>Percentages are based on 15,654 responses to this question (99.7% of all respondents).</p>
				<p>Overall trends in respondents’ education remained the same in 2011, with those holding college or university degrees representing the majority. However, over the years, the percentage of those who answered grade/primary school, high/secondary school, or some college or university has decreased slightly each year. When taken together, responses in these categories have fallen from 32.2% in 2008 to 26.9% in 2011.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Relevance of education</h3>
				<hr />
				<aside class="canvascell">
					<canvas width="600px" height="450px" class="canvasw" id="relevanceedu"></canvas>
				</aside>
				<p>Percentages are based on 15,660 responses to this question (99.7% of all respondents).</p>
				<p>Once again, respondents most commonly said their education has “some” relevance to their work. The overall breakdown of responses to this question has not changed substantially since 2008.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Excited by field</h3>
				<hr />
				<aside class="canvascell">
					<canvas width="600px" height="450px" class="canvasw" id="excitedfield"></canvas>
				</aside>
				<p>Percentages are based on 15,637 responses to this question (99.6% of all respondents).</p>
				<p>This year, the vast majority of respondents—85.9%—reported being excited by their field either “a lot” or “some.” This question was worded differently in past years, so comparisons are difficult.</p>
