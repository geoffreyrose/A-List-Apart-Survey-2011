				<p>The ongoing upward shift in age we noted in the 2010 results continued in 2011. For the first time since we started using these brackets in 2008, respondents in the 30-44 range (up from 44.0% in 2010) overtook those in the 19-29 range (down from 47.2% in 2010).</p>

				<p>As in years past, respondents were overwhelmingly male. Over the five years this question has been asked, a slightly higher percentage of respondents has selected female each year: 16.1% in 2007, 16.2% in 2008, 17.4% in 2009, 17.6% in 2010, and 18.0% in 2011; however, overall results are very similar to past years. The addition of Other did not appear to significantly change this pattern.</p>
